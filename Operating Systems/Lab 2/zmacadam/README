Horned Frog Shell (hfsh.c)

This program is a shell that can run in either interactive mode (no arguments) or batch mode (one argument, file name)

My shell program passes all the tests given and a few of my own, leading me to believe that it has all the functionality required of the assignment

It handles:
Parallel Commands
Redirection
Built in Commands
Variable whitespace (including lack of whitespace)

My shell program can take:
10 commands per line
20 arguments per command
25 PATH variables at one time

These values can be changed by changing:
max_args in the #define statement at the top
max_cmds and max_path at the beginning of the main function.

One thing I will say about the testing of this program using the tests you gave:	
	I was very disappointed to run my program this morning using the tests and to see that the program failed tests! 
	It had just worked on all the tests last night! 
	Turns out, other students were not properly removing their files in /tmp, because they were testing at the same time.
	This led me to completely overhaul some of the functionality of my code, retesting it and rewriting it when it turns out my code was fine.
	Because I could not access the file they had created and not removed, I was scrambling until I realized I just had to rename the file to create in the test/*.in file.
	Maybe give students a heads up that their shell can affect other people when using a directory all students can access like /tmp.

I am proud of my shell! I hope it works :)
