This folder contains 4 utility programs written in C

tcat: Has nearly the same behavior as the utility cat except when no file is specified.
      Prints the contents of file(s) line by line, if the file can be opened.
      Command takes the following CL arguments: ./tcat searchterm [file...] 

tgrep: Has behavior similar as the utility grep.
       Searches the given file(s) for lines containing the given search term if the file can be opened. If the term is found, the line is printed to the console.
       If no file is specified, the tgrep command attempts to match standard input to the search term given.
       If the empty string is given as a search term, all lines in the file are matched.
       Command takes the following CL arguments: ./tgrep searchterm [file...] (file not required)

tzip: Uses run-length encoding (RLE) to zip given file to standard output, hopefully the zipped file is smaller than the unzipped file! (Chances are it won't be).
      Important thing to note: tzip also zips null bytes! 
      Command takes the following CL arguments: ./tzip [file...] 

tunzip: Takes a file zipped using RLE and unzips it, outputting results to standard output. Handles null bytes and returns the file back to the exact size it started as.
	Command takes the following CL arguments: ./tunzip [file...]
